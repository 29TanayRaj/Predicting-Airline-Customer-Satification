# Predicting-Airline-Customer-Satification
An airline company wants to perdict whether a customer is left satisfied with thier flight or not.

Airline satisfaction is important for several reasons:

- Customer Retention: Satisfied customers are more likely to continue using the services of an airline, leading to repeat business and customer loyalty.

- Reputation Management: Positive experiences lead to favorable word-of-mouth recommendations and reviews, which can enhance the airline's reputation and attract new customers.

- Competitive Advantage: In an industry as competitive as the airline industry, customer satisfaction can serve as a differentiator. Airlines that consistently deliver satisfactory experiences may gain a competitive edge over their rivals.

- Revenue Generation: Satisfied customers are more likely to spend money on additional services or upgrades, such as seat upgrades, in-flight meals, or priority boarding, contributing to the airline's revenue.

- Cost Reduction: High levels of customer satisfaction can reduce costs associated with customer complaints, refunds, and compensations for poor service experiences.

- Regulatory Compliance: Many aviation authorities require airlines to meet certain standards of customer service and satisfaction as part of their regulatory obligations.

Overall, ensuring customer satisfaction is crucial for the long-term success and sustainability of an airline business.
