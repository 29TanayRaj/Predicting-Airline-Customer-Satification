**Purpose**: To automate the process of finding the customer was satified or not without explicility asking them.

### Approch
In this project an deep learning approch is taken to tackle this problem by building an ANN model. KerasTuner was used to get a basic model and the results were compared with an experimental model.


**Project Document** - Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries Used** - Tensorflow, Keras, KerasTuner, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and pandas
