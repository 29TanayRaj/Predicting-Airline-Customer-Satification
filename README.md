# Predicting-Airline-Customer-Satification
An airline company wants to perdict whether a customer is left satisfied with thier flight or not.

**Purpose**: To automate the process of finding the customer was satified or not without explicility asking them.

**Approch**
In this project an deep learning approch is taken to tackle this problem by building an ANN model. KerasTuner was used to get a basic model and the results were compared with an experimental model.

 - An airline dataset with **103904** entries was used.
 - An **Artificial Neural Network** was build with **keras API** and using an enternal libary **KerasTuner**.
 - The type of Ann Model was Sequential.
 - Test Accuracy of **96%** was achived with the model.
 - Another experimental model was build for comparision with the model build with the keras tuner.
**Project Document** - Jupyter Notebook.

**Libraries Used** - Tensorflow, Keras, KerasTuner, Pandas, Skit-learn, Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas.
